# LAB REPORT 3 FOR WEEK 6

Hi, this is Jenny Quach lab report 3. My PID is A16706054. 

## 1. Streamlining ssh Configuration
- I was able to edit the config file from ssh on vscode using the extention from vscode

- By adding those lines into my ~/.ssh/config. I was able to log into my remote server by just using the alias ieng6 instead of the whole username like I used to do.

- I added a file name hello.txt into the folder of week6-labreport3 and then copy that file into the ssh server using my alias "ieng6"
